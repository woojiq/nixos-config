### TODO
* Alt-tab
* Sound/brightness inc/dec dunst notification (wob)
* Starship `impure nix shell` smaller msg
* Chrome wrong resolution on opening

### FIX

### Might be fixed/broken in the next app release
* [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/issues/1958): wireplumber crash
* Tokei: colored output
* [Helix](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/5379): I'll probably want to use the old version after this merge
